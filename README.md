# Maintenance Mode Notice
I do not personally use this and as such will have limited time to invest into this project. Basic things will be fixed,
however larger issues from either changes from Zoneminder or otherwise will likely not be fixed. If there is substantial
demand for a new feature/improvement, I will consider implementing it if I have time. Sponsoring me and noting this is
the reason you are doing so will help me invest more time into this as well.

# Why
This is an automatically updating ZoneMinder container built using s6-overlay with full support for all things containers.
This aims to be the container that will never die as things will automatically keep themselves up to date and allow for
easy selection/testing of various ZoneMinder versions.

This container aims to follow all of the best practices of being a container meaning that the software and persistent
data are separated, with the container remaining static. This means the container can easily be updated/restored provided
the persistent data volumes are backed up. 

Not only does this aim to follow all of the best practices, but this also aims to be
the easiest container with nearly everything configurable through environment variables
or automatically/preconfigured for you!

There is also full support for multi-server setups with automation to link all servers!

# How

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
2. Download docker-compose.yml or docker-compose-multi.yml depending on single/multi server setups.
3. Download .env
4. Place all these files in the same folder and configure .env and the yml files as you please.
5. Run `docker compose up -d` to start.

NOTE: The default docker-compose.yml files use the `latest` tag which runs the latest release build of ZoneMinder.

## Defining a Version

1. Replace `latest` in the `docker-compose.yml` file with any ZoneMinder version you would like to run.
You can find all available releases [here](https://github.com/zoneminder-containers/zoneminder-base/releases).
Ex. `1.36.1`

Note: For those new to Docker, these values are known as the container tag.

### Available Tags

- `branch_name`: This is the branch name of this repository, not Zoneminder.
- `release`: References the latest release
- `latest`: Same as release
- `nightly`: Nightly builds from master on Zoneminder

## Updates

1. Replace the tag with the new version to update to, or for `latest`, simply continue to the next step.
2. `docker compose pull`
3. `docker compose up -d`


# Helpful Info
Logs are rotated according to the [TAI64N standard](http://skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-log.html)

`/data` is not included in fix-permissions because it takes a substantial amount of time to run for the events folder
when there are a large number of files

The web interface is accessible at the root directory. Do not use the /zm subdirectory to access the interface.
